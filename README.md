(first look of the project)

I created this project from a challenge, it was proposed to create a music website, so I created a site based on Spotify, using technologies like HTML, CSS and Javascript programming language, so that I could add a playlist to the site itself I used an API that Spotify provides, the purpose of the project was for it to be responsive and to work. The layout of the project was all built by me, I hope you like it!
